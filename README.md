# Simple-Calculator
This is a simple calculator project in Python to go over the fundamentals of building a program.
I believe that making a calculator is one of the fastest ways to learn the major parts of a building a project with a programming language.
Any additions can be added or improved on this until sufficient proficiency in the language has been achieved.
